# Play Asset Delivery ANE

> Play Asset Delivery (PAD) brings the benefits of app bundles to games. It allows games larger than 150MB to replace legacy expansion files (OBBs) by publishing a single artifact to Play containing all the resources the game needs. PAD offers flexible delivery modes, auto-updates, compression, and delta patching, and is free to use. Using PAD, all asset packs are hosted and served on Google Play removing the need to use a content delivery network (CDN) to get your game resources to players.
> 
> Play Asset Delivery uses asset packs, which are composed of assets (such as textures, shaders, and sounds), but no executable code. Through Dynamic Delivery, you can customize how and when each asset pack is downloaded onto a device according to three delivery modes: install-time, fast-follow, and on-demand.

This AIR native extension brings the ability to access your assets at runtime in your AIR application.
